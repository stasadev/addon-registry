## What is ddev-unstructured?

This add-on quickly enable the [Unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io/) service into a [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) project.

Just a heads-up—there isn't an Unstructured API image build for Silicon Macs (arm64) yet. 
Instead, we’re using the build for Linux/amd64. For more details, check out issue [#480](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api/issues/480).

## Getting started

Install the add-on with `ddev add-on get robertoperuzzo/ddev-unstructured`.
